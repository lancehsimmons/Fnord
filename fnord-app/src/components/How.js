      <p>Fnord posts take two forms: Regular Posts and Void Posts.</p>
      <h5>Regular Posts:</h5>
      <p>What you might think of as a "regular" post, that is, one authored by you, the user, are automatically redacted. Fnord would like to encourage you to engage with your truest thoughts and share them freely, without fear of reproach.</p>
      <h5>Void Posts:</h5>
      <p>The second, more unusual type of posts on Fnord are called Void Posts. These are can be generated with just a few clicks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select a few regular posts that feel intriguing. Click the "void" button that appears at the bottom of each post</li>
        <li>Each void post you select adds the body of that post to the <span>Void Cloud.</span></li>
        <li>Once three posts have been selected, the <span>Void Cloud</span> has reached Terminal Density</li>
        <li>Click the Emit button that appears at the top of the feed to generate a new Void Post.</li>
        <li>The information that was swallowed by the Void emerges now, in a new form, as a Void Post, twisted by the chaos of the void</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Fnord offers access to the Void as a means of subverting your own preconceptions and perhaps generating new exciting avenues of thought.</p>

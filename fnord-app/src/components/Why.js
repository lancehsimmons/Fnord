      <h3>Why Fnord Arth Thou?</h3>
      <p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fnord'>Fnord</a> seeks the liberation of information through recontextualization. The aim is to subvert the exploitative norms of social media while simultaneously providing a tool for the cooperative generation of novel texts. Fluxus media artist <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasunao_Tone'>Yasunao Tone</a> used the term “paramedia” to describe his work, the goal of which was to dismantle media formats to find new exciting forms. In Fnord the Paramedia concept is extended to the social media paradigm; hence, Social Paramedia.</p>
      <br />
      <p>One of the main techniques of Fnord is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique'>cut-up.</a> Simple algorithmic processing lends itself easily to the practice of rearranging text material in the pursuit of new surprising ideas. The technique has a long-standing history in the roots of Surrealism and Dadaism and extends to the realm of American Literature through the pioneering work of William Burroughs. It seems fitting now, when our desires for the pursuit of meaning and substance are being exploited en-mass in the interest of capital gain, to reintroduce these tools. Fnord offers itself as an island of respite in a sea of violent logical sensibilities.</p>

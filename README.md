social paramedia platform


## Project Description

Fnord seeks the liberation of information through recontextualization. The aim is to subvert the exploitative norms of social media while simultaneously providing a tool for the cooperative generation of novel texts. Fluxus media artist [Yasunao Tone](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/yasunao-tone-and-mp3deviation.pdf?c=icmc;idno=bbp2372.2010.046) used the term “paramedia” to describe his work, the goal of which was to dismantle media formats to find new exciting forms. In Fnord the Paramedia concept is extended to the social media paradigm. 

Users are prompted to make posts expressing their thoughts under a pseudonym. However, when displayed the contents of these posts are redacted. In this way users are able to freely express themselves without fear of reproach. The other option for engagement takes two parts: users can select previous posts to be added to an abyssal chaos cloud. Once the cloud reaches terminal capacity a new, fully-visible post is generated from an agglomeration of the material added to the cloud. All posts can be added to the cloud or deleted. 

Fnord also provides tools for processing texts with the methods used by Dadaists and later popularized by William Burroughs and Bryan Gysin. Fnord considers itself an act of information freedom
